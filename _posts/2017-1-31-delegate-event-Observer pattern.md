### Delegate

You can see the simplest way of adding a page is just to add an HTML ( or markdown ) file in the root directory with a suitable name for the page you want to create. For example, aahome.md is the homepage link, about.md is the about page.

All sidebar boxes html files are in the <code>_include</code> directory, their name begin with upper case. You can chose which sidebar boxes appears in the main page on the <q>sidebar.html</q> in the <code>_includes</code> directory.
